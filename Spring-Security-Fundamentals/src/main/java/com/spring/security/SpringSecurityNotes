		The Fundamentals
			.what is Security
			-Authentication
				Authentication is a process of letting and application know who you are?
				Typically, when we access any application, for example, banking application, the first step is to
				log in by providing our user ID and password.The banking application will validate that user id and password.
				This process is called authentication.
				If the authentication is successful, then we can access other pages in the application.
				If not, we cannot.
				
			-Authorization
			Next is authorization, once a user logs in or authenticate, how does the application know how much
			access the user or another application has?
			That is where authorization jumps in and it uses roles to do authorization.
			Each role is mapped to certain	URLs or methods in the application, and the user with certain roles 
			will have access to certain
			functionality within the application and certain users will not have access to certain functionality
			
			
		Different way of Authentication
			Basic Authentication
			formed based
			OAuth (SSO)
			
			
		Integrity
